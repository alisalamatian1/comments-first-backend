# comments-first-backend

This is the first website I wrote that involves backend.
This website is not hosted on the internet, so you have to use the localhost(with port 4000).
I faked a database, called tweets, which is an array of objects. Each time a user adds a comment, this fake database gets updated.
I also used a library to generate random id for each comment.
